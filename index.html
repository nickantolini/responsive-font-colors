188         Lat Austyn have his swynk to hym reserved!
     Let Augustine have his work reserved to him!

     I saw his sleeves lined at the hand
194         With grys, and that the fyneste of a lond;
     With squirrel fur, and that the finest in the land;
195         And for to festne his hood under his chyn,

196         He hadde of gold ywroght a ful curious pyn;

     There was an elaborate knot in the larger end.

     His head was bald, which shone like any glass,
199         And eek his face, as he hadde been enoynt.

200         He was a lord ful fat and in good poynt;
     He was a very plump lord and in good condition;
201         His eyen stepe, and rollynge in his heed,

     Which gleamed like a furnace under a cauldron;
203         His bootes souple, his hors in greet estaat.
     His boots supple, his horse in excellent condition.
204         Now certeinly he was a fair prelaat;

208         A FRERE ther was, a wantowne and a merye,
     There was a FRIAR, a pleasure-loving and merry one,
209         A lymytour, a ful solempne man.
     A limiter (with an assigned territory), a very solemn man.
210         In alle the ordres foure is noon that kan
     In all the four orders of friars is no one that knows
211         So muchel of daliaunce and fair langage.

     With landowners every where in his country,
217         And eek with worthy wommen of the toun;
     And also with worthy women of the town;
218         For he hadde power of confessioun,
     For he had power of confession,
219         As seyde hymself, moore than a curat,
     As he said himself, more than a parish priest,
220         For of his ordre he was licenciat.

221         Ful swetely herde he confessioun,
     He heard confession very sweetly,
222         And plesaunt was his absolucioun:

223         He was an esy man to yeve penaunce,
     He was a lenient man in giving penance,
224         Ther as he wiste to have a good pitaunce.
     Where he knew he would have a good gift.
225         For unto a povre ordre for to yive
     For to give to a poor order (of friars)
226         Is signe that a man is wel yshryve;
     Is a sign that a man is well confessed;
227         For if he yaf, he dorste make avaunt,
     For if he gave, he (the friar) dared to assert,
228         He wiste that a man was repentaunt;
     He knew that a man was repentant;
229         For many a man so hard is of his herte,
     For many a man is so hard in his heart,
230         He may nat wepe, althogh hym soore smerte.
     He can not weep, although he painfully suffers.
231         Therfore in stede of wepynge and preyeres
     Therefore instead of weeping and prayers
232         Men moote yeve silver to the povre freres.

236         Wel koude he synge and pleyen on a rote;
     He well knew how to sing and play on a rote (string instrument);
237         Of yeddynges he baar outrely the pris.

238         His nekke whit was as the flour-de-lys;

242         Bet than a lazar or a beggestere,
     Better than a leper or a beggar-woman,
243         For unto swich a worthy man as he

244         Acorded nat, as by his facultee,
     It was not suitable, in view of his official position,
245         To have with sike lazars aqueyntaunce.
     To have acquaintance with sick lepers.
246         It is nat honest; it may nat avaunce,
     It is not respectable; it can not be profitable,
247         For to deelen with no swich poraille,
     To deal with any such poor people,
248         But al with riche and selleres of vitaille.
     But all with rich people and sellers of victuals.
249         And over al, ther as profit sholde arise,

250         Curteis he was and lowely of servyse;
     He was courteous and graciously humble;
251         Ther nas no man nowher so vertuous.
     There was no man anywhere so capable (of such work).
252         He was the beste beggere in his hous;

252a         Noon of his bretheren cam ther in his haunt;]
None of his brethren came there in his territory;]
253         For thogh a wydwe hadde noght a sho,
     For though a widow had not a shoe,
254         So plesaunt was his "In principio,"
     So pleasant was his "In the beginning,"
255         Yet wolde he have a ferthyng, er he wente.

256         His purchas was wel bettre than his rente.

257         And rage he koude, as it were right a whelp.

258         In love-dayes ther koude he muchel help,
     He knew how to be much help on days for resolving disputes,
259         For ther he was nat lyk a cloysterer

260         With a thredbare cope, as is a povre scoler,
     With a threadbare cope, like a poor scholar,
261         But he was lyk a maister or a pope.
     But he was like a master of arts or a pope.
262         Of double worstede was his semycope,
     Of wide (expensive) cloth was his short cloak,
263         That rounded as a belle out of the presse.
     Which was round as a bell fresh from the clothespress.
264         Somwhat he lipsed, for his wantownesse,
     Somewhat he lisped, for his affectation,
265         To make his Englissh sweete upon his tonge;
     To make his English sweet upon his tongue;
266         And in his harpyng, whan that he hadde songe,
     And in his harping, when he had sung,
267         His eyen twynkled in his heed aryght
     His eyes twinkled in his head exactly
268         As doon the sterres in the frosty nyght.
     As do the stars in the frosty night.

290         Ful thredbare was his overeste courtepy,
     His short overcoat was very threadbare,
291         For he hadde geten hym yet no benefice,

841         Ne studieth noght; ley hond to, every man!"
     And study not; lay hand to (draw a straw), every man!"
842         Anon to drawen every wight bigan,

845         The sothe is this: the cut fil to the Knyght,
     The truth is this: the draw fell to the Knight,
846         Of which ful blithe and glad was every wyght,

     Like one who was wise and obedient
852         To kepe his foreward by his free assent,
     To keep his agreement by his free assent,
853         He seyde, "Syn I shal bigynne the game,
     He said, "Since I must begin the game,

855         Now lat us ryde, and herkneth what I seye."
     Now let us ride, and listen to what I say."
856         And with that word we ryden forth oure weye,
     And with that word we rode forth on our way,
857         And he bigan with right a myrie cheere
     And he began with a truly merry demeanor
858         His tale anon, and seyde as ye may heere.
     To tell his tale straightway, and said as you may hear.
